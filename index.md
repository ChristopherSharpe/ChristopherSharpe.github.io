## Christopher Sharpe's E-Portfolio

Hello, my name is Chris Sharpe. I am a 26-year-old student in the computer science program here at SNHU. I have been in this program since 2018 or for three years, while also working a full-time job, which has made it quite the challenge. I have learned a lot in this program and believe that it will help me in my career goals and help me reach my dream. 
	I have learned so much in this program, that it is hard to decide where to begin. Some great example of this would be learning how to use Java, Python, and C++, as well as SQL and MongoDB. I have also learned how important secure coding is, as well as learning about different operating systems/environments that can be used, and even data mining. Although I find all these things important, especially the coding aspects, I believe the three most important things I have learned are:
1.	Secure coding- Keeping a secure coding mindset to ensure the safety of the program I am creating as well as keeping the user’s information safe, is very important to me, and will help me move forward knowing how to do this. 
2.	Data Structures and algorithms- Without understanding how important data structures and algorithms are to coding, I would not be very good at it. Having this knowledge will allow me to create much better programs in the future and save time and headache while doing it.
3.	Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance- Without testing and automation, a lot of program would not only have a ton of issues, but they would also be very vulnerable to attacks, which would allow attackers to gain information about users that are supposed to have been kept private. This also goes for Quality Assurance, because without this, most programs would have bug’s that users would not like, and this would most likely cause users to not use this program/product anymore. 
I believe these are the most important things I have learned in this course, although I know all of them will be important for my future. 
	Although my current career has nothing to do with computer science, I know that my future career as a software engineer will have everything to do with it. My plans involve getting a job to start off as a software engineer at an entry level and continue to learn and grow over the next couple of years. After this, I want to become a senior software engineer, hopefully working with AI and robotics. After around five years of working at this, and perfecting the craft, I want to launch my own company, and create AI that will help people in many ways. Artificial Intelligence will definitely be the specialization I target for my career, because my future career goals and dreams hinge upon understanding and being able to create wonderful AI that will hopefully change the world. 

## Informal Code Review
When it comes to computer science, there are many ways in which you can make an impact. From software development to analytics, there are many key roles in the computer science world that it takes to continue to push boundaries and influence change in technology. For my project, I chose a website that I have been working on, and want to make it better and more efficient, by adding elements that will allow my website to be used by users from all over, while maintaining security. I plan to add new code to allow for more to be done on the website as well as ensure the safety of the information of the user. In this document I will dive into each of these three categories to explain further what I plan to change or incorporate into this website:
1.	Software Engineering
2.	Secure coding
3.	Database/Database management
The first thing I want to do with this project is add more pages for the information that I do not want featured on the front page, these pages include:
1.	About us page
2.	Content page
3.	Merchandise page
4.	Contact us page.
After adding these pages, I will insert more code to add information needed for each of these pages. After this, I want to add a login/register feature to allow visitors the ability to view the content, purchase merchandise, and leave comments on the content page. Although I will not be fully setting up the merchandise page to be functional during this project, it will be there with visuals of the merchandise that the brand has. The content page will have a live stream on it, as well as videos that have been recently created. My plan is to add more functionality to this website not just for the owner, but also for the people who visit the website. This is the pseudo code I came up with to kind of outline my plans, and how I plan to achieve them:
1.	Add new web pages.
a.	About us
i.	Add information to this page.
b.	Content
i.	Create placeholder for videos and stream.
1.	Add videos and stream to page.
c.	Merchandise
i.	Add images for merchandise.
1.	Add pricing.
2.	Contact us.
a.	Create contact form that will send information to business email.
3.	Create ability to login/
a.	Add OAuth to allow user to login with other login information from other sites.
i.	Create form to fill out to create user profile.
1.	Save information to database.
4.	Add social media Content to about us and Content page.
a.	Add social media buttons.
i.	Link Social Media accounts.




Using the same project, a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will also be incorporating secure coding practices by implementing data structures as well as implementing secure coding into the website to ensure information is taken care of correctly. The entire website is like a data structure in a way. I will be creating a home page, in which you will be able to access new and different pages from. For example, from the home page you will be able to go to four different pages, such as about us, contact us, merchandise, and content pages. Once you go into this page, I will have layered code in which you can click on something on this page, that may take you to a video off the page, i.e., a video on YouTube. I will also be using a data structure to create a database to store user information in when a user signs up on the site. Another great thing I will be implementing is something like OAUTH, which will allow a user to sign in using another sites login information, and that user will be issued an authentication token that will be used to log the user in. Here is how I plan to do this:
1.	Add ability to navigate to different pages.
a.	Create links on pages to go to other sites. I.E. Social media/YouTube.
2.	Create ability to login/
a.	Add OAuth to allow user to login with other login information from another site.
i.	Create form to fill out to create user profile.
1.	Save information to database.
When it comes to saving the information that users put in to create a profile, I will be using a database, SQL to be exact. When a user signs up, this information will be sent to the SQL database, and saved. Information such as:
1.	First and Last name
2.	Country
3.	Username
4.	Address
5.	User Auth Token
After the user enters this info it will be save into a database as being their profile, which they will be able to log-in to using log-in information from another site, and then will be assigned a user Authentication token, which will be saved in their profile in the database. Here is how I plan to do this.

1.	Create SQL database
a.	Create data trees and arrays to keep information.
i.	Link database to webpage
2.	User logs in using oAuth.
a.	User enters information for profile.
i.	Information is saved to database.
3.	User can log-in to profile and use website.
Throughout this course, I believe updating and implementing all these things will allow me to change the website in a much better user-friendly experience, and an all-around better website. I also hope to ensure the safety of user information by making all these changes and provide not just the organization with a wonderful website, but also provide their fans with an amazing page in which they can feel like they are part of the organization as well. 

## My Stance on Code Reviews
A code review is a review of, most likely a peer’s, computer source code. The whole point of this review is to look through the code and find and fix mistakes that could have been made and overlooked by the original developer during the development phase. The great thing about code review is that it “improves the overall quality of software as well as the developers’ skills.” (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/524235/Codeplusreviewplusguidelines) This is a very important part of the development process, because it will help ensure there are very little to no mistakes and issues within a software before it is implemented. Testing only goes so far, as the “average percentage of defect detection for testing is only 25%, while using code reviews, that number jumps up to 55 to 60 percent.” (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/524235/Codeplusreviewplusguidelines) This is just one of the great examples of why code reviews are important. The main reason it is so important to conduct code reviews is to ensure that errors will be caught and fixed before the software is implemented, however it is to be implemented. 
	When it comes to when a code review is to take place, there are a few possible times and places in which in which you can do a code review, which include:
•	Post Check-In
•	Pre-Check in
•	Got it working.
Most of the time the code review will happen with the post check-in, which will be after the code is complete. However, there is also time in which you can review code, which is Pre-check in, which would be every time you make a change, before you move on to the next steps. Lastly, there is got it working, which is when you have it working. This essentially would entail getting the program working, then making it clean. 
	There are some very important code review practices that can be used to ensure you are getting an effective code review. Some of the best ones that I believe are the most helpful include:
•	Review fewer than 200-400 lines of code at a time.
•	Take enough time for a proper, slow review, but not more that 60-90 minutes.
•	Establish quantifiable goals for code review and capture metrics so you can improve your processes.
•	Use checklists because they substantially improve results for both authors and reviewers.
(https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2015/07/23/what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review/)
These are the main practices that I believe will lead to the best code review, and I know that they will also give you the most efficient code review as well. For example, by reviewing fewer than 200-400 lines of code at a time, you will keep from having to spend more time on one code review than you have. This also ties in with another good one, which is to take enough time out for a proper review, but not take more than 60-90 minutes. Essentially, by doing fewer than 200-400 lines of code at a time, you will be able to take your time, and do the most effective code review, that will most likely result in the best review possible, and by this, I mean that you will be able to catch and fix more errors within the code. Although I did not touch base on all these best practices that I included, I chose them because they all tie in together, and will allow you to have effective and efficient code reviews. 
## Portfolios and how I feel about them!
Portfolios are an amazing way to show off your talent, and the work that you have achieved so far in your discipline. Whether it be art, computer science, or even writing, developing a portfolio to show-case your work is a great way to get that job you have been wanting, or even just get your work out there for people to see and admire and give feedback on. E-Portfolios have become a growing trend in the last 10 years, and I do not see that trend going anywhere anytime soon. 
When it comes to applying for certain jobs, having an ePortfolio can give you a leg up on the competition, as it is a showcase of the work you have done, and shows the hiring manager/’s that you have the skill to do the job that you are applying for. For example, if you are applying for a job that requires the use of coding in Java language, and you have plenty of this in your portfolio, you can share this with the company, and it will give you a much better chance of getting the job, because they see that you have that skillset. However, it can also help you even in just freelance work. A great example would be doing freelance work on fiver. On your profile, or on the job that you post, you can attach your portfolio, and show others what you have done, which could easily lead to you getting more jobs. 
There are some downsides to publicly posting your portfolio, such as theft of intellectual property. When you post your portfolio, especially publicly, you are allowing others to see what you have done, whether it be code or even writing, your work can be stolen, and without protection or copyrights, they can take the credit for this work. I believe that the best way to combat this would be to keep your portfolio private or creating a portfolio with a password if you are just using it to gain employment, because you can choose who you share it with. However, companies can still take this information or work and use it as their own, although this is unlikely. You can also add a copyright notice, which will let others know that you will pursue litigation if your work is used and proper acknowledgement is not given. 

## Progression Milestones
### 01.25.21
  The artifact I am working on is a website for a gaming organization that I used to be a part of called, “Carnage Gaming”. I started it about a week before I began this class, and decided to make it my final project, because I knew that I would be able to showcase some important things that I have learned throughout the years in my courses. I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website, and have learned a lot more over the course of this project. 
I believe that this project will be a great addition to my e-Portfolio, because it shows a lot of what I have learned and shows that I can put this information to use in real world applications. It also shows that I can create a clean and layered project that will also allow secure user use and a way to store this information securely as well. This showcases my skills in many ways, and here are some good examples: 
•	HTML shows that I can create a clean code that can be easily read and changed when needed. 
•	CSS shows that I understand the concepts of how to style and change the way the information on a website is displayed, changing it to the needs and wants of the customer/people who I am designing for. 
•	The JavaScript portion shows that I can create viable code that can go beyond just that of creating a website. I believe it shows that I understand the basic concepts of programming as well as some advanced concepts, and how to use them. 
In this enhancement, I was able to show what I believe to be, great strides in the software design/engineer section of this project. I was able to fix issues I had on the Home page and add code for both the About Us and Contact Us page. I was also able to ensure that these three pages were all working and styled using CSS the way I wanted to. Overall, these were the improvements I had planned to make in this enhancement section and believe that I did a great job getting it done, and without little to no issues with the code. However, I am going to have to change plans when it comes to the security section, as I do not believe I have the time to implement the oAuth code I wanted to use, and instead will be using more achievable code that will still ensure the safety of the user information I will be obtaining. 
When I was working on these enhancements, I hit some snags, one which took me two days to figure out. This was on the About Us page, and I could not quite get the text to line up on the side of the image, and or get the image in its place. However, I realized that I was leaning to much on the CSS aspect, and not using the html tools that would make this easier. When I finally realized it would be much easier to do and control in HTML, I was able to fix this issue and a few others, learning new code, and problem-solving techniques along the way. I also learned that while CSS is a wonderful tool for styling, its more effective to use the tools of HTML and JavaScript. 
This last week I spent a lot of time working on the software design/engineering aspect of my project and was able to complete this part of the project to the point in which I believe will be enough for this course but hope to continue to build on this aspect throughout the course. I also began thinking about how I want to go about the next step, which is algorithms and data structures. I plan to create a secure way for users to login/register on the website using secure coding, which will include data structures and algorithms, to ensure the protection of the passwords that will be stored in an SQL database. I have also began plotting my approach to creating the SQL database and ensuring I will be able to get this information to get from the site to the database. I was able to get some issues with the initial code I started this class with, as well as create two new pages with their own styles using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page is complete for now, and is usable by the user, with every clickable link working, and every aspect of the page in the place that it needs to be. 
	Overall, I believe that I had a very productive week, and although I had some issues, and hit some snags along the way, I was able to get through them, fix the issues, and learn more about every aspect of creating a website throughout the week.

### 02.01.21
 In the second enhancement, I worked on the data structure and algorithms portion of my project, by creating data structures that would take in information from the website such as the login/register pages and store them into the databse. I got most of the work that I wanted to get done, done in this enhancement, however I fell a little short. I got the the data structures created, and connected to the database, however I could not get them to grab the information from the webiste and put it in the database. I will continue working on this after this course, but I believe it will take some more studying and debugging to ensure I get this right, and also ensure that the data is safely being obtained and securely stored in the database. I may have been able to get it to work in a work-around, however I decided against this because I am always trying to have a secure coding mindset, which I have learned is a great tool in this program. To ensure the saftey of the information, I decieded to work on this after the course to ensure the user information that will be obtained is safe and secure. 
 	Throughout this enhancement I hit so many issues that I had no idea how to deal with at first. However, instead of floundering and freaking out, I just took a step back and worked through one issue at a time until I got it right, then moved on to the next. I believe this is the best method when debugging and dealing with issues within your code, because trying to fix multiple things at once will lead you to just create more issues. Although I did'nt get everything I wanted done in this enhancement, I believe that I had a productive week, and helped myself move forward in the project to ensure I will be able to complete it soon. 
### 02.07.21
  In this enhancement, I was able to create my sqlite3 database, and get it connected to the website, as well as the server.js file that will allow it to run, create the table for the database, and insert data from the registration form to the database. Although I did not quite get where I wanted to, I believe that this was a major step toward being able to take this website live as well as adding a polished and completed project to my e-portfolio. This part I did not get finished, which I will be working on this next week was getting the information from the database to pass through this file and into the database. The creation of the database itself was easy, it was getting it connected to the actual html file and getting to live locally that was the issue. 
While working on the enhancement’s this week, I came across a lot that I have yet to do, and while it was hard, I found the experience that came with pushing through the pain and heartache to be well worth it. Although I did not complete all the tasks I wanted to, I got through some very tough hurdles, and cannot wait to tackle the rest this in the coming weeks. I do not believe I will have a website that is ready to go live by the end of the class now, however, I know that it will be very close.
